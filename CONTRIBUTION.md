# Contributions to Compo

All contributions are welcome, but we are aiming to follow the syntax as close to the Microsoft Expression Language as possible.

Functions that exists in the Microsoft Expression Language, but not in Compo, are welcome to be added in the 'default' function space.

Functions that are not in the Microsoft Expression Language, but are useful in a general are expected to 'live' in its own namespace.

We use semantic versioning and the release are automated based on this, so please mark you commits according to the [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit format.
